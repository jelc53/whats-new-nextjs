The *Whats New?* project is a wiki for short, visually engaging summaries of academic publications within the fields of applied math and computer science.

You can visit our website at [whatsnew.wiki](whatsnew.wiki).

## Getting Started

Clone and cd into the repository on your local machine.

Run the development server: `npm run dev`.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing webpages by modifying `page.tsx` files within `app/` directory. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Web Deployment

The app is statically deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) with GitHub integration. 

Every push to `main` automatically triggers a new build and re-deployment routine.

Check out [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for Vercel documentation.
